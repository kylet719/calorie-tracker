# Calorie Tracker 210 Project


My project for this term will be a **calorie tracker**. My goal for this project is to track the calories you are eating
from day to day and to provide an analysis on those days. The goal is for the analysis to give you a high-level overview
of your diet to meet your daily caloric goals.

Users of this project will be myself and other individuals who are trying to be mindful of what they put into their 
body. Will be used in tandem with a daily caloric target which will be custom depending on the individual.

This project is of interest to me because I always struggled with my weight, whether it be eating too little or too
much. As such, I believe having a meal tracker that not only tracks but analysis your diet will be a huge asset.
